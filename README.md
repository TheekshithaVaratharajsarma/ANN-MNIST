# Iris Flower Classification using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

This repository contains the implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for the classification of Iris flowers based on the famous Iris dataset. The Iris dataset includes measurements of four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, for three different species of Iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.
